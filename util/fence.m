% Plots a fence panel of radar / seismic data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%
% xaxis - vector of values for the x-coordinate of the radar data
% yaxis - vector of values for the y-coordinate of the radar data
% zaxis - vector of values for the z-axis of the fence
% data - matrix containing intensity values for the radar image
% [transparent] - value [0 1] indicating the transparency of the panel
% [resample_rate] - integer, downsamples the input matrix
% [colormap] - string for the colormap of choice. Only required if you want
%              to lock the colors to a specific colormap
